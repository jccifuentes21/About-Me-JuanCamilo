## Welcome to my page! :)

My name is Juan Camilo Cifuentes (you can call me JC). I am 24 years old, I was born in **Bogota, Colombia**. Moved to **Mexico** at age 8, and have lived there ever since.

I recently graduated from a Bachelors Degree in _Mechatronics Engineering_ in June 2021, at ITESM (Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey). 

### Hobbies

My main hobby is *golf*. I spend as much time as I can playing and watching golf. The reason for this is that I believe that it is one of the hardest sports created because there are a lot of variables that apply to the game and you can never master it.

Amnother one of my hobbies is *technology*. I am very passionate about all kinds of technoogy, ranging from cellphones and computers, to smart appliances, all the way to electric cars. I find myself very interested in how the future could be, where tech and automation play a big part of our lives. 

Robotics is also one of my passions, this is the reason why I studied my degree in Mechatronics. 

I like programming a lot, and would love to one day develop a website or app that everyone uses, and have it stand out from others.
